Embedr Frontend
===============

This is the frontend of the Embedr search engine, which displays a search bar and the results as IIIF images.

Project setup
-------------

The project uses Grunt to build the project and bring various elements together. There is a Wordpress instance in the wordpress folder. The search is implemented in JavaScript using React. These are processed and copied into a build directory, which is deployable to a place that has a Wordpress configuration.
